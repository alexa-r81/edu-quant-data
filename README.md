#I chose this data set because one of my close friends smokes a lot, so I was interested in the statistics. The column I chose was the age at which kids in the survey begun smoking. I was very surprised by some of the data, because there was more young smoking than I thought there were be. I think it was about 95 kids who had their first cigarette under the age of 8, which was very curious to me and said a lot about the issue of smoking in America. There's a lot more quantitative data in the data set, so maybe I will use this set again for something quantitative.
